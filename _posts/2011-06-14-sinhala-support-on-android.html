<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)">Android</a> has become the OS which powers many smart phones.But as it lacks built in Sinhala support,we have to add it by our own.Even these steps gives you a partial sinhala support in your mobile,the text won't be rendered well in most places.<br />Currenty,we have partial or full support on following;<br /><br />1.Sinhala text displaying<br />2.Sinhala text input<br />3.Sinhala web browsing<br /><br />For Sinhala text display in any app,you have to install a Unicode font with Sinhala support,basically you have to replace DroidSansFallback.ttf font in /system/fonts with Sinhala unicode font.(Your mobile has to be rooted for this and there are number of guides on the internet.Just "Google" about your mobile phone rooting.)These are wonderful guides on how to do this.<br /><br /><a href="http://sinhala.kalingasblog.com/2010/07/25/sinhala-unicode-on-android-google-nexus-one/">Kalinga's blog post</a><br /><a href="http://gayannrx86.blogspot.com/2010/10/installing-sinhala-on-android.html">GayanX86's blog post</a><br /><br />Now you got the "Sinhala text displaying" in your mobile.<br /><br />There is no input method for Sinhala,hence I've created custom layout based on Wijesekara keyboard layout and submitted it to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/hackerskeyboard">hackerskeyboard</a> app development team.With there support now it's available on hackerskeyboard v1.16rc3 and above.You can get it from(or <a href="https://market.android.com/">android market</a> itself later),<br /><br /><a href="http://code.google.com/p/hackerskeyboard/downloads/list">http://code.google.com/p/hackerskeyboard/downloads/list</a><br /><br />Please note that "Rakaranshaya" and "Kombuwa" is not working yet.If you are an android developer please try correct that problem.<br /><br />Here are some screenshots of the input:<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DRSlQ6dOGkw/TfchMMd7E-I/AAAAAAAAAeY/Daa-7ugLMwA/s1600/snap20110614_141946.png"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 267px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DRSlQ6dOGkw/TfchMMd7E-I/AAAAAAAAAeY/Daa-7ugLMwA/s400/snap20110614_141946.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5617995553556861922" /></a><br /><br />Even though now you can view sinhala webpages,it lacks proper rendering,There is an great app created by <a href="http://dhanikauom.blogspot.com">Dhanika</a>,which can render Sinhala in webpages.You just have to install it.<br /><br /><a href="http://code.google.com/p/sett-browser/">http://code.google.com/p/sett-browser/</a><br /><br />Hope you will able to get Sinhala support on android,if there is any prob please put a comment.I will post more about the input development.

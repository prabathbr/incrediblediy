I was wondering to use some <a href="www.microchip.com">PIC</a> 18F microcontrollers in my projects.The well known <a href="http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/Devices.aspx?dDocName=en010280">18F2550</a> & <a href="http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/Devices.aspx?dDocName=en010300">18F4550</a> got USB which is much useful in current environments.But the problem was didn't have a good programmer to program them.My intention was to build a good USB programmer like PICKIT2lite but it also need a 18F2550 which should be programed in order to use this.So,I was looking for a very simple and easy to build programmer for 18F.Luckily I was able to find such,called ART2003 programmer.It just needs a 220 Ohm resistor,a 47uF capacitor and some 1N4148 diodes.All these parts are available at any part of the country.The total cost for this project was below Rs:100/=<br /><br />Here's my little programmer :)<br /> <br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mNYpwvKw7vY/TfsQuj4P0uI/AAAAAAAAAeg/NJsIl7FQwMQ/s1600/DSC00455_800x600.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mNYpwvKw7vY/TfsQuj4P0uI/AAAAAAAAAeg/NJsIl7FQwMQ/s400/DSC00455_800x600.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5619103352166011618" /></a><br /><br />The schematic can be found at:<br /><a href="http://www.foxdelta.com/products/art2003.htm">Fox Delta</a><br /><br />I use WinPIC 800 v3.59 which also can be found on that link to program the microcontroller.Make sure you have enabled Low Voltage Programming(LVP) fuse.<br />You have to connect PGM,PGC,PGD,MCLR,VDD,VSS pins according to your uC's datasheet.<br /><br />Now I can build my own PICKIT2lite USB programmer :) <br />You can also use this simple programmer to programmer a <a href="http://eegeek.net/content/view/13/32/1/1/">Bootloader</a> and then you can change the program on microcontroller without any programmer by just using USB.
